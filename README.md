# Speller
To be system wide spellcheaker using crystal

#### How it will work:

* the user highlights a word or words(paragraphs or sentances) and runs this program,
  could be a keyboard short cut. (completed)

* the program detects spelling errors in the highlighted text and tells you whats spelt wrong (completed)

* the user will have the option to add or blacklist words for there own system dictionary (not started)

* the program uses an algrithm to figure out best matching words to replace the spelling errors (not started)

* the program will intergret with some sorta notification or gui system to display the spelling mistakes (not started)

#### Requirements

* this application requires `xsel`. for arch `pacman -S xsel`

#### Current Output
for example i highlighted all the text above *Current Output* and ran the program, this was the current output:
![image]("/img/speller_test.png")
note: i cant spell, hence why im doing this project
